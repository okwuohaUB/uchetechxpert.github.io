## About

Hi, I'm Okwuoha Uche Bethel, a passionate Fullstack Developer with expertise in both frontend and backend technologies. I love building scalable, user-friendly web applications that deliver seamless experiences.

With a strong foundation in Key Technologies, such as  JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, SQL/NoSQL, I enjoy turning ideas into functional and elegant solutions. Whether it's crafting responsive UIs or optimizing server performance, I thrive on solving complex problems with clean, efficient code.

When I'm not coding, you can find me refactoring and debbugging. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
